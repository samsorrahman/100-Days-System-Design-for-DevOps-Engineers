## 📆 Day-by-Day Plan

### ✅ Day 1: Conceptual Understanding

#### 📖 Read and Watch
- [x] Read the [GeeksforGeeks DDD article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/domain-driven-design-ddd/).
- [x] Watch the [YouTube video on DDD implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-ym035R1eY&t=34s).

#### 🔍 Explore GitHub Samples
- [x] Browse [`ddd-by-examples/library`](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples/library) for end-to-end modeling and layering.
- [x] Check [`Sairyss/domain-driven-hexagon`](https://github.com/Sairyss/domain-driven-hexagon) for Hexagonal Architecture patterns.

#### 🧠 Design Your Domain
- Define your **Bounded Contexts**, **Entities**, and **Value Objects** for a sample domain, such as:
  - Task Manager
  - E-commerce Store
  - Blogging Platform

---

### ✅ Day 2: Build a Sample Application

#### 🧱 Domain Layer
- Create Entities like `Order`, `Customer`, or `Post`.
- Add Value Objects like `EmailAddress`, `Price`, or `Address`.

#### ⚙️ Application Layer
- Write simple use cases like:
  - `CreateOrder`
  - `PostArticle`
  - `RegisterUser`

#### 💾 Infrastructure Layer
- Implement in-memory Repositories and persistence logic.
- Optional: Stub out interfaces for database adapters or event publishers.

#### ✅ Testing
- Add unit tests to validate core domain logic and interactions.

#### 🔁 Compare and Reflect
- Compare your structure with the GitHub examples and identify improvement areas.

## 📝 Best Practices

- ✅ **Use Ubiquitous Language** shared by both developers and domain experts.
- ✅ **Isolate Domain Logic** from external frameworks or infrastructure concerns.
- ✅ **Emphasize Behavior Over Data** — models should expose business rules, not just state.
- ✅ **Evolve and Refactor** your domain model as your understanding grows.
- ✅ **Abstract Infrastructure** using interfaces and dependency inversion.

## 💡 Summary

In this 2-day sprint:

- 📖 You explored key DDD concepts through articles, videos, and open-source repositories.
- 🏗️ You designed and built a small application based on a well-structured domain model.
- 🔄 You compared your work with real-world examples to refine and validate your implementation.

Use this foundation to grow your DDD skills further—by diving into:

- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event Sourcing
- Modular Monoliths
- Domain Events and Event-driven architectures
- Microservices using DDD
